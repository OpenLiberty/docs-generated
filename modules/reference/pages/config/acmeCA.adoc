|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+accountContact+

|string

|

|+A contact URL the ACME server can use to contact the client for issues related this the ACME account.+

|+accountKeyFile+

|string

|+${server.output.dir}/resources/security/acmeAccountKey.pem+

|+A path to the file containing a key identifier for a registered account on the ACME CA server. If the file does not exist, a new account is registered with the ACME CA server and the associated key is written to this file. Back this file up to maintain control of the account on the ACME CA server.+

|+acmeRevocationCheckerRef+

|A reference to top level acmeRevocationChecker element (string).

|

|+Configuration for checking the revocation status of certificates with the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).+

|+acmeTransportConfigRef+

|A reference to top level acmeTransportConfig element (string).

|

|+ACME transport layer.+

|+challengePollTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+120s+

|+The amount of time to spend polling the status of an ACME challenge before polling discontinues and treats the challenge as failed. A value of 0 indicates to poll indefinitely. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+directoryURI+

|string +
Required

|

|+The URI to the ACME CA server's directory object.+

|+domain+

|string

|

|+A domain name to request a certificate for.+

|+domainKeyFile+

|string

|+${server.output.dir}/resources/security/acmeDomainKey.pem+

|+A path to the file containing a key identifier for a domain. If the file does not exist, a new key is generated and written to this file. Back this file up to maintain control of the domain.+

|+orderPollTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+120s+

|+The amount of time to spend polling the status of an ACME order before polling discontinues and treats the order as failed. A value of 0 indicates to poll indefinitely. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+renewBeforeExpiration+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+7d+

|+Renew time before expiration. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+subjectDN+

|string

|

|+Subject distinguished name (DN) to use for the certificate. The DN can include the following relative distinguished name (RDN) types: cn, c, st, l, o and ou. If the cn RDN type is defined, it must be one of the domains defined by the domain configuration element and it must be the first RDN in the DN. If the cn RDN type is not defined, the first domain defined by the domain configuration element is used as the cn RDN value.+

|+validFor+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|

|+The duration of time that the certificate signing request specifies for the certificate to be valid. The default is defined by the ACME CA server. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+
